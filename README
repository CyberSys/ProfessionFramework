Profession Framework Mod for Project Zomboid

by Fenris_Wolf

Adds a framework to simply adding additional professions to project zomboid, and editing the default
professions. As well as simplifying adding special traits to professions (brave, lucky, etc), it also 
simplifies  the processes of adding starting gear to various professions.

Be aware this mod adds no new professions or traits itself, it is merely a framework.
